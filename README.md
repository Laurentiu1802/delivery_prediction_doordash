Delivery Duration Prediction

This Python project, developed in Jupyter Notebook, aims to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery
in the DoorDash platform. Accurate delivery time estimation significantly impacts consumer experience, making it a critical aspect for DoorDash.
The dataset, stored in historical_data.csv, contains delivery records from early 2015 across various cities where DoorDash operates.
Each record includes features such as timestamps, store information, order details, and market conditions. The target variable is the
total delivery duration in seconds.


This project involves analyzing various features such as time, store, market, and predictions from other models to predict delivery durations 
accurately. It encompasses model selection, evaluation, data processing, feature engineering, and modeling approaches to enhance prediction accuracy 
and interpretability. The ultimate aim is to develop a robust model that contributes to a seamless consumer experience on the DoorDash platform.

As of this moment, I started with Data Exploration. This first part includes creating new features and do feature engineering. The next part is going to 
be preparing the data for modeling, but for the moment I am a little bit stuck at the data prep.
